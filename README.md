## Abstract
Gather a list of data sets, type of datasets, and hyperparameters by running an expanded list of datasets. This information will be embedded in a database management system, to be incorporated into a website where it is easy to be searched and used by the public.
The hyperparameter database is created by running millions of hyperparameter values, over thousands of public datasets and calculating the individual conditional expectation of every hyperparameter on the quality of a model.
Generate models using H2O software to find the best hyperparameters and create a conceptual model and store all the data into a physical database.

## Objective:
To create Hyperparameter Database by running several hyperparameter values on several datasets and to calculate the individual conditional expectations on every hyperparameter on quality of model

## Data source
Data is derived from Kaggle Datasets. We have chosen considered dataset of Travel Insurance.
